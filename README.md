# Gale-Shapley
Program that implements the famous Gale-Shapley heuristic algorithm used for solving the Stable Marriage Problem. There are many applications of this algorithm including hospital-resident matching, High school-student matching in NYC, Employer-Employee matching, US Navy sailor- boat matching etc. This program implements the high school-student matching application. The program currently needs correctly formatted text files to work. Each line in the School text files must be as follows:

# [Name as a String],[Alpha weight as a double] 
[School_Name_As_String], [Alpha_Weight_as_double>]

Ensure that the text file ends with one blank line as above.

Each line in the Student line must be formatted as follows:

[Student_Name_As_String],[GPA_as_double],[Extra-Curricular_Score_as_Int],[School_they_ranked_as_1st_as_Int],[School_they_ranked_as_2nd_as_Int],[School_they_ranked_as_3rd_as_Int]
